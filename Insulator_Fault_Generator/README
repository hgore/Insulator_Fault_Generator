This program run as is will attempt to find the fault that generates a known heatmap.


Important variables:
In "geneticalgorithm/genetic.java"
	epoch: controls the number of trials that will be run, currently set to 5000
		Each epoch will take ~5 seconds when run on 4 processors each with 16
		 cores given 6144MB of memory.
	N = number of faults checked per eopch, needs to be a power of 2 
		(or divisible by 4) (currently 64)
	arraysize: side length of the FEM array. currently 6
	triangle_number: 2*(arraysize)^2 the number of FEM sections
	defect_no: controls the number of broken sections of the FEM array.
			This must be equal to or less than triangle_number
			Currently 9, goal is for this to be random.
	dimension: the number of inputs to the finite element calculation's input file
			This is filled out by a function, all of the inputs can be edited.
	
In "geneticalgoirthm/costs.java"
	real[i]=#
		Each number is a temperature in the heat array. They are in order from the 
			top left of the heatmap to the bottom right, read left to right.
		The heatmap can be calculated for a given defect with the 
		 HeatTransfer.java method, but that is not seperated here.
